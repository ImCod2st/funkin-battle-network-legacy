# funkin-battle-network-legacy
An old **Friday Night Funkin' online multiplayer** version of the rewritten FNF Godot engine but not the one I rewrote for Funkin' Battle Network and also not the other one I rewrote for Funkin' Battle Network. This was the first*.<br>
<sub>\* actually technically the second but the first one was more of a prototype</sub>

The code here is a mess, but its a charming mess! :)<br>
If you want to contribute, **good luck.**

It is built with **Godot 3** using the built-in **high-level multiplayer api**.

## Setup
If you want to compile with the online mod repo you'll need to provide the game a [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).<br>
This whole system isn't implemented very well like I should not be using these for this purpose but oh well! Maybe some day!

Create a file named **env.ini** in root and copy the text below. <br>
Replace all values with your own.
```ini
[AUTH]
GITHUB_TOKEN="INSERT TOKEN HERE"
```

## Important Notes
I am putting this here as a just incase because it has happened before.

Do not *(without permission)*:
- Take code from this project and use it in yours.
- Make "revival" projects out of this. Just contribute to this one, please.
- Release a compiled build on my behalf. (You can share a build with friends but do not go publishing this on Gamebanana or Gamejolt or something.)
